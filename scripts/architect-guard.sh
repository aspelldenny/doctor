#!/usr/bin/env bash
# architect-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook để chặn cứng Architect đọc source code
#
# How it works:
#   - Hook fires on every Read / Glob tool call
#   - Reads JSON from stdin (Claude Code hook payload)
#   - Detects if the call is from the Architect agent (via marker file)
#   - If Architect is trying to read src/, exits 2 with an error
#
# Setup: this script is referenced from .claude/settings.json under hooks.PreToolUse.
# Architect agent must create marker file `.sos-state/architect-active` on spawn.
# (Marker lives outside .claude/ so YOLO mode doesn't prompt — .claude/ is gated
# even with --dangerously-skip-permissions because it holds settings/hooks.)
#
# Note: NO external deps (no jq) — uses pure shell + sed/grep for cross-platform
# compatibility (esp. Windows msys2 bash where jq is not bundled).

# Strategy: greedy regex on flat JSON. Works for both:
#   {"tool_input":{"file_path":"src/main.rs"}}
#   {"tool_input":{"pattern":"src/**/*.rs"}}
# This is fragile for nested quotes but Claude Code paths don't contain them.

🚫 Architect envelope violation

Architect cannot read source code: $PATH_ARG

What to do instead: write a Task 0 anchor in the phiếu.
Example:
  | # | Assumption | Verify by | Result |
  | 1 | <claim about $PATH_ARG> | grep ... $PATH_ARG | ⏳ TO VERIFY |

Worker (separate subagent) will grep-verify it for you. The constraint IS the feature.
